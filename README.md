# IMAGE CAPTIONS

In this folder, you will find examples about image captioning. For protection of reference blogâ€™s rights, I do not add images and weights which are given by them. I just add some of results from my notebooks. Keywords and concepts of notebooks are given below : 

1.)	Implementing a reusable image caption feature extractor: explained feature extraction for image caption on flickr8k dataset

2.)	generate_caption_model: build and train our model for image captioning

3.)	Generate captions on images : implementing our model for new images
