# IMAGE CAPTIONS

In this folder, you will find examples about image captioning. For protection of reference blogâ€™s rights(TensorFlow 2.0 Computer Vision Cookbook), I do not add images and weights which are given by them. I just add some of results from my notebooks.You can find detailed information from 5th chapter in book or the github repo( https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Tensorflow-2.0-Computer-Vision-Cookbook/tree/master/ch7). Keywords and concepts of notebooks are given below : 

1.)	Implementing a reusable image caption feature extractor: explained feature extraction for image caption on flickr8k dataset

2.)	generate_caption_model: build and train our model for image captioning

3.)	Generate captions on images : implementing our model for new images
